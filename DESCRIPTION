Description: Evaluates the probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), quantile function (QF), random numbers and maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of well-known complementary binomial-G, complementary negative binomial-G and complementary geometric-G families of distributions taking baseline models such as exponential, extended exponential,  Weibull,  extended Weibull, Fisk, Lomax, Burr-XII and Burr-X. The functions also allow computing the goodness-of-fit measures namely the Akaike-information-criterion (AIC), the Bayesian-information-criterion (BIC), the minimum value of the negative log-likelihood (-2L) function, Anderson-Darling (A) test, Cramer-Von-Mises (W) test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P-value and convergence status. Moreover, some commonly used data sets from the fields of actuarial, reliability, and medical science are also provided. Related works include:
